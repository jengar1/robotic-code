# robotic-code
this will be a beginner rough scripted code that will then be embedded to MATLAB
sensors will have to be coded seperatley due to the linking of the robot.
src will be used to link files together (each part of the robot will be coded seperatly and then linked later on)
conversion to matlab may be different
developer languages c++, java,python, possible javascript 
currently doing research on robotic links
this is an industrial robot (linear equations and kinesiology will be needed to develope proper codes)
sensors will be coded differently from the actuators
do not assigne files to links until there is a visual of the robot
i will create a 3d model of the robot
fullstack software engineer of 40 years will teach the baiscs of the links and punch codes when he is finished with his project.
javascript is pending and the robot will be linked to an actual scanner. different repsository will be needed to create the scanner but projects will be linked through matlab. estimated time of rough code developement will be 3-6 months with research. code changes based on type of robot. small attributes matter the robot will not run if its not properly structured. robot will need a server due to the load of data. we can use a rough (fake) API instead of hard API to test the robot.
