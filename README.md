# robotic-code
scripted code embedded to MATLAB
sensors will have t coded seperatley due to the linking of the robot
src will be used to link files together
conversion to matlab may be different
developer languages c++, java,python, possible javascript 
currently doing research on robotic links
this is an industrial robot (linear equations and kinesiology will be needed to develope proper codes)
sensors will be coded differently from the actuators
do not assigne files to links until there is a visual of the robot
i will create a 3d model of the robot
