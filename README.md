# ðŸ¤– Robotics Development Project

This project focuses on developing an industrial robot from the ground up using modular code that will later be integrated into MATLAB for full simulation, control logic, and sensor data analysis. Each component of the robotâ€”links, sensors, and actuatorsâ€”will be coded separately and then combined after a complete 3D visualization model is created. The approach emphasizes structure first, ensuring every detail of the robotâ€™s foundation is mathematically and logically sound before movement or automation is introduced.

The main goal is to build a flexible and scalable robotics system that can adapt to different hardware setups. Research will focus heavily on robotic links, linear algebra, and kinematics to ensure precise motion and stability. Sensors and actuators will be handled independently due to differences in their communication protocols. Integration into MATLAB will allow advanced testing and modeling using Simulink and the Robotics Toolbox.

The project uses multiple programming languagesâ€”Python as the primary base, with potential integration in C++, Java, and JavaScript. MATLAB will serve as the final embedding and simulation environment. During the early testing phase, a mock API will be used instead of a live one to simulate system interactions without overloading the network. Because of the expected data volume, the final version of the robot will run on a dedicated server capable of handling telemetry and computational loads.

The development process will take place in several stages: initial research into robotic kinematics and motion equations; writing rough code for modular parts; creating a 3D model for visualization; integrating the modules through MATLAB; running simulations using the mock API; and finally connecting the robot to real-world hardware such as an industrial scanner. Each step builds toward a stable and testable robotic framework.

The code structure is simple and organized:
- **/src** holds the core scripts, including links, actuators, sensors, and math utilities.  
- **/models** will store the 3D designs and structure files.  
- **/tests** is used for simulation and validation scripts.  
- **/docs** includes all research notes, equations, and design data.

Nothing will be linked until the full 3D model is complete, as structural accuracy determines whether the robot functions correctly. Even the smallest attribute mattersâ€”if the robot is not properly structured, it will not run. A senior full-stack software engineer with over 40 years of experience will provide mentorship on linking systems, writing punch codes, and connecting virtual design with physical robotics once his current project concludes.

In the future, a separate repository will be created for the industrial scanner, which will connect through MATLAB. Plans also include real-time visualization of sensor feedback, a data-handling server, and converters between Python, C++, and MATLAB for cross-language compatibility. The projectâ€™s estimated timeline for research and early development is about three to six months, with active adjustments based on findings during testing.

Ultimately, this project is about precision and patience. Every small attribute, calculation, and connection matters. Structure comes before motion, and the system must be reliable before it is automated.
